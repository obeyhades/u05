# Restful API - Financal tracker

I have chosen to create an API that is a finance tracker. In the API, users will be able to create an account (register). They will be able to add their income, expenses, and saving goals.

## 1. Objekt Modeling

### Databasstruktur

- userId (unik ID fÃ¶r user)
- name
- Email & password (Hashed)
- createdAt (timestamp)

### Income

- incomeId
- userId (reference for user)
- amount
- category (salary, investment, etc...)
- date (?)

### Expenses

- expenseId
- userId (reference for user)
- amount
- category (food, rent, transport, etc... )
- date (?)

### Savings Goals

- goalId
- userId (reference for user)
- targetAmount
- currentSavings
- deadline (?)

## 2. Create Resource URIs/ Assign HTTP Methods

| PUT    | /income/:id |        Update a transaktion |
| DELETE | /income/:id |       Removes a transaktion |

| PUT    | /goals/:id |            Update a saving goal |

## 3. Resource Representations
